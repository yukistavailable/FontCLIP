class ExMultiheadAttention(Module):
    r"""Allows the model to jointly attend to information
    from different representation subspaces as described in the paper:
    `Attention Is All You Need <https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762>`_.

    Multi-Head Attention is defined as:

    .. math::
        \text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \text{Concat}(head_1,\dots,head_h)W^O

    where :math:`head_i = \text{Attention}(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V)`.

    ``forward()`` will use a special optimized implementation if all of the following
    conditions are met:

    - self attention is being computed (i.e., ``query``, ``key``, and ``value`` are the same tensor. This
      restriction will be loosened in the future.)
    - Either autograd is disabled (using ``torch.inference_mode`` or ``torch.no_grad``) or no tensor argument ``requires_grad``
    - training is disabled (using ``.eval()``)
    - dropout is 0
    - ``add_bias_kv`` is ``False``
    - ``add_zero_attn`` is ``False``
    - ``batch_first`` is ``True`` and the input is batched
    - ``kdim`` and ``vdim`` are equal to ``embed_dim``
    - at most one of ``key_padding_mask`` or ``attn_mask`` is passed
    - if a `NestedTensor <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nested.html>`_ is passed, neither ``key_padding_mask``
      nor ``attn_mask`` is passed

    If the optimized implementation is in use, a
    `NestedTensor <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nested.html>`_ can be passed for
    ``query``/``key``/``value`` to represent padding more efficiently than using a
    padding mask. In this case, a `NestedTensor <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nested.html>`_
    will be returned, and an additional speedup proportional to the fraction of the input
    that is padding can be expected.

    Args:
        embed_dim: Total dimension of the model.
        num_heads: Number of parallel attention heads. Note that ``embed_dim`` will be split
            across ``num_heads`` (i.e. each head will have dimension ``embed_dim // num_heads``).
        dropout: Dropout probability on ``attn_output_weights``. Default: ``0.0`` (no dropout).
        bias: If specified, adds bias to input / output projection layers. Default: ``True``.
        add_bias_kv: If specified, adds bias to the key and value sequences at dim=0. Default: ``False``.
        add_zero_attn: If specified, adds a new batch of zeros to the key and value sequences at dim=1.
            Default: ``False``.
        kdim: Total number of features for keys. Default: ``None`` (uses ``kdim=embed_dim``).
        vdim: Total number of features for values. Default: ``None`` (uses ``vdim=embed_dim``).
        batch_first: If ``True``, then the input and output tensors are provided
            as (batch, seq, feature). Default: ``False`` (seq, batch, feature).

    Examples::

        >>> multihead_attn = nn.MultiheadAttention(embed_dim, num_heads)
        >>> attn_output, attn_output_weights = multihead_attn(query, key, value)

        Args:
            query: Query embeddings of shape :math:`(L, E_q)` for unbatched input, :math:`(L, N, E_q)` when ``batch_first=False``
                or :math:`(N, L, E_q)` when ``batch_first=True``, where :math:`L` is the target sequence length,
                :math:`N` is the batch size, and :math:`E_q` is the query embedding dimension ``embed_dim``.
                Queries are compared against key-value pairs to produce the output.
                See "Attention Is All You Need" for more details.
            key: Key embeddings of shape :math:`(S, E_k)` for unbatched input, :math:`(S, N, E_k)` when ``batch_first=False``
                or :math:`(N, S, E_k)` when ``batch_first=True``, where :math:`S` is the source sequence length,
                :math:`N` is the batch size, and :math:`E_k` is the key embedding dimension ``kdim``.
                See "Attention Is All You Need" for more details.
            value: Value embeddings of shape :math:`(S, E_v)` for unbatched input, :math:`(S, N, E_v)` when
                ``batch_first=False`` or :math:`(N, S, E_v)` when ``batch_first=True``, where :math:`S` is the source
                sequence length, :math:`N` is the batch size, and :math:`E_v` is the value embedding dimension ``vdim``.
                See "Attention Is All You Need" for more details.
            key_padding_mask: If specified, a mask of shape :math:`(N, S)` indicating which elements within ``key``
                to ignore for the purpose of attention (i.e. treat as "padding"). For unbatched `query`, shape should be :math:`(S)`.
                Binary and byte masks are supported.
                For a binary mask, a ``True`` value indicates that the corresponding ``key`` value will be ignored for
                the purpose of attention. For a byte mask, a non-zero value indicates that the corresponding ``key``
                value will be ignored.
            need_weights: If specified, returns ``attn_output_weights`` in addition to ``attn_outputs``.
                Default: ``True``.
            attn_mask: If specified, a 2D or 3D mask preventing attention to certain positions. Must be of shape
                :math:`(L, S)` or :math:`(N\cdot\text{num\_heads}, L, S)`, where :math:`N` is the batch size,
                :math:`L` is the target sequence length, and :math:`S` is the source sequence length. A 2D mask will be
                broadcasted across the batch while a 3D mask allows for a different mask for each entry in the batch.
                Binary, byte, and float masks are supported. For a binary mask, a ``True`` value indicates that the
                corresponding position is not allowed to attend. For a byte mask, a non-zero value indicates that the
                corresponding position is not allowed to attend. For a float mask, the mask values will be added to
                the attention weight.
            average_attn_weights: If true, indicates that the returned ``attn_weights`` should be averaged across
                heads. Otherwise, ``attn_weights`` are provided separately per head. Note that this flag only has an
                effect when ``need_weights=True``. Default: ``True`` (i.e. average weights across heads)

        Outputs:
            - **attn_output** - Attention outputs of shape :math:`(L, E)` when input is unbatched,
              :math:`(L, N, E)` when ``batch_first=False`` or :math:`(N, L, E)` when ``batch_first=True``,
              where :math:`L` is the target sequence length, :math:`N` is the batch size, and :math:`E` is the
              embedding dimension ``embed_dim``.
            - **attn_output_weights** - Only returned when ``need_weights=True``. If ``average_attn_weights=True``,
              returns attention weights averaged across heads of shape :math:`(L, S)` when input is unbatched or
              :math:`(N, L, S)`, where :math:`N` is the batch size, :math:`L` is the target sequence length, and
              :math:`S` is the source sequence length. If ``average_weights=False``, returns attention weights per
              head of shape :math:`(\text{num\_heads}, L, S)` when input is unbatched or :math:`(N, \text{num\_heads}, L, S)`.

                `batch_first` argument is ignored for unbatched inputs.
